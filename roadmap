fix camera: look up and down weird zoom effect
only upload textures that are used in materials
memory requirement log thingy
sphere skybox only tophalf option
skybox cubemap
hdr skybox
optimize pow: gamma correct images before upload and gamma correct after AA
refraction
roughnessmaps
bi/trilinear texture filtering
sRGB now, use aces, linear colours
preprocess kernel: optimize branches away, insert constants

features:
raytracing:
spheres, planes
albedo(shadows), specular
reflection
AA
textures uv(planes,spheres)
albedo,normalmaps
skycolour,skybox(sphere)
camera controls
